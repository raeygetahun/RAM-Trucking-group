    <h2>About us:</h2>
    Within a local area the LTL freight operator has a number of vehicles which collect shipments from 
    their customers. After finishing the daily collection, the shipments are taken to a terminal where 
    the vehicles are unloaded. Each shipment is weighed and rated which allows customer bills to be processed. 
    The individual shipment is loaded on to an outbound vehicle which contains shipments from other customers 
    bound for the same geographic area. The outbound shipments are trucked to appropriate regional terminals, 
    where they are unloaded. The shipments are sorted and placed on local vehicles for delivery. Each individual 
    shipment is handled a number of times from the time it is picked up from the customer until it reaches its 
    final delivery location.
